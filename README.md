It is necessary to implement a tool for downloading files from the Internet (HTTP client). The URL is set from the command line; the program should download the contents to disk.
Implementation Requirements:
0. The C or C ++ language, the gcc compiler, use only the capabilities of the standard library (libc or std: :).
1. The primary priority is reliability. There should be no bugs, either explicit or hidden / potential (which appear after a minor code change).
2. The second priority is performance.
3. The third priority is elegance and minimalism.
The program must be compiled and run on Linux.
This is creative task, everything that is not described in the  task remains at your discretion
